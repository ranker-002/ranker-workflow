skill: oneshot-feature
context:
  business_goal: "Reduce setup time and enforce high-quality feature specs for every new request."
  technical_scope: "Add `ranker-agentic-workflow feature <slug>` command that creates a filled feature task file under .ultra-workflow/tasks."
acceptance_criteria:
  - "CLI command `feature <slug>` creates `.ultra-workflow/tasks/feature-<slug>.yml` if workflow exists."
  - "Generated file includes non-empty: id, title, owner_agent, skill, context, acceptance_criteria, implementation_plan, quality_gates, status."
  - "Command fails with clear message if `.ultra-workflow/tasks` does not exist."
  - "Command never overwrites existing task file unless `--force` is provided."
  - "Validation command reports generated task as valid."
implementation_plan:
  - "Add new command parser branch for `feature` in CLI."
  - "Implement slug sanitizer and deterministic FEAT id generation."
  - "Generate YAML content with strict default contract."
  - "Add overwrite protection and `--force` support."
  - "Run `validate` on generated file as verification step."
