# Improve install docs: npm vs GitHub fallback

Users hit npm E404 and are unsure whether to stop or continue.

## Requested
- Show npm path and GitHub fallback path clearly.
- Clarify that GitHub fallback can run all commands, not only `init`.

## Acceptance criteria
- README has explicit examples for fallback with `ci-check`, `feature`, and `run`.
